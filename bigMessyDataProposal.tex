\section{Dataset Selection}

We will use daily news for stock selection data on Kaggle datasets\newline (https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews). \newline\newline
This dataset consists of two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dow Jones Index.
\item Top 25 daily news headlines in Reddit. 
\end{enumerate}
\section{Potential Questions to Investigate}
\begin{enumerate}
\item First, we want to look into if there exist the correlation of how "big" the news are and the volume on the Dow Jones.\newline
Intuitively, this should make sense because some unexpected important news will lead the market into horror, which will lead to the increase of volume.
\item Second, we want to see if there is any correlation with company specific news related to companies in Dow Jones.\newline
To achieve the second objective, if the Reddit news is not enough, we will look into alternative data sources for news.
\item Third, we will see what other features (volumes, volatility etc.) of other index or assets are predictive of news (especially the sector specific ones.)\newline
This step might involve more gathering of alternative financial data (which can be big and messy).\newline

\end{enumerate}
